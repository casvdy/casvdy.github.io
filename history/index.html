                        **College of Applied Science, Vadakkencherry (CAS VDY): A Historical Overview**  

**Introduction**  
Established in 1993, the College of Applied Science (CAS VDY) in Vadakkencherry, Palakkad district, Kerala, India, stands as a pioneering government institution under the Institute of Human Resources Development (IHRD), a Government of Kerala undertaking. Affiliated with the University of Calicut and recognized under Section 2F of the UGC and AICTE, CAS VDY embodies its motto, *“Think Globally, Act Globally,”* through its commitment to innovative education in applied sciences and commerce.  

**Founding and Early History**  
CAS VDY was founded with a vision to deliver specialized undergraduate programs in emerging fields. It made history as the first college in Kerala to introduce B.Sc. Electronics and Computer Science, reflecting its forward-thinking approach to technology education. Situated along National Highway 47, approximately 33 km from both Palakkad and Thrissur, the college’s strategic location enhances accessibility for students across the region.  

**Academic Expansion**  
Over the decades, CAS VDY expanded its academic portfolio to include postgraduate programs and specialized diplomas. A landmark achievement came in 2010 with the launch of Kerala’s first government-level Postgraduate Diploma in Audio Engineering, positioning the college as the fourth institution in India to offer such a program. This initiative underscored CAS VDY’s dedication to addressing industry demands and fostering niche skill sets.  

**Academic Programs**  
The college offers a diverse range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses under the semester system, aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) of India. Key programs include:

Each association, guided by faculty advisors, organizes workshops, seminars, and technical events, cultivating leadership and collaborative skills among students.  

**Placement and Career Development**  
CAS VDY’s proactive Placement Cell bridges academia and industry, offering training programs, real-time workshops, and mock interviews to enhance employability. Collaborations with corporate partners enable campus recruitment drives, while personality development sessions led by industry experts prepare students for competitive environments.
